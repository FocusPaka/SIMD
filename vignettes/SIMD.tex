#1 Introduction
SIMD method is developed for jointly analyzing MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data,
which are derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments
followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes
experiments for unmethylated CpGs (MRE-seq). We have implemented the
SIMD method via a set of R functions with the computational intensive parts
written in C. We make a R package named SIMD and give a tutorial for
the package. The method consist three steps.
Step 1: Data Pre-preparation;
  Calculate the CpG count.
  Calculate the MRE CpG count.
  Calculate MeDIP-seq tag count of each site of control and treatment
samples.
  Calculate MRE-seq tag count of each site of control and treatment
samples.
Step 2: Calculating p-values of each CpG site by the EM test;
Step 3: q-values for FDR control;

We use a part of a real dataset to illustrate the usage of the SIMD package.
The programs can run under the windows 10 system. The
R versions should larger than 3.5.0.

#2 Preparations
Before installing SIMD package, the user must install two other R pack-
ages, which can be done using the following commands.
